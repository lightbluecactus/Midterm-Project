	<h1>Dogs are the best, no doubt about it.</h1>
	<h2>Here comes the question: is large dogs better than small dogs?</h2>

	<h3>Reasons FOR:</h3>
	<p>Large dogs are very gentle. Usually they do not bark a lot or easily get over excited. If the owners feel upset, they could get a LARGE hug from their dog!</p>
	<p>You can teach your large dog to do many things, even wash your clothes.</p>

	<p>...Well they may learn how to identify the clothes you want to wash first.</p>



	<h3>Reasons AGAINST:</h3>
	<p>Once you have a large dog, you'll spend a lot more time and energy to take care of them. A small dog is much easier to breed, and could still be a funny doggo!</p>

	<p>If the owners train them properly, small dogs won't bark a lot as well.</p>
